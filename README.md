# 🛡️ CTF Writeups

Welcome! This is a curated collection of my personal writeups from platforms like **TryHackMe**, **picoCTF**, and **Hack The Box**, created as part of my ongoing growth in cybersecurity and offensive security.

These writeups focus on **techniques, tools, and takeaways** rather than just answers, and are shared here to document my learning, demonstrate hands-on experience, and contribute to the community.
